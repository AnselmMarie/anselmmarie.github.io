My role was to code, design, and help manage the team. There was a strong focus on UX and accessibility. With great communication with the network, back-end, and business team, we were able to launch the application. After the app launching, it became a success and I was rewarded with \"The AT&T Service Excellence Award\" soon after.</p>",
