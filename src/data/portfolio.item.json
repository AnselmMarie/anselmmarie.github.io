      "description": "Cricket Wireless wanted a way to allow new customers to activate there service on any phone. Using an agile process I lead a team to build an web application to do this. While designing and developing the app there was a strong need to make sure the app was accessible to the color blind, visually impaired and etc. We had an internal focus group to test the app and enhance areas where negative comments where given. Once the app launched it became successful. Because of the success, my hard work and help from my team I was able to get the The AT&T Service Excellence Award.",
