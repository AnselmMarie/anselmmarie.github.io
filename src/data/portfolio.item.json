      "description": "Cricket Wireless wanted a way to allow new customers to activate their service on any phone. So I lead a small front-end team to build the web application Breeze-Thru. There was a strong focus on UX and accessibility. Around mid-way of the development, an internal focus group tested the app. Then we enhance areas where negative comments were given. When the app launched, it became a success and this lead to me being rewarded with The AT&T Service Excellence Award.",
